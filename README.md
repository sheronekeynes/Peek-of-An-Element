# Peek-of-An-Element
An array A with N elements is called a mountain if there is an index 'i' such that,A[0] &lt; A[1] &lt; A[2] &lt; ... &lt; A[i], and A[i] > A[i+1] > A[i+2] > ... > A[N-1] Here, the element at index  i  is called the peak element of the mountain. Given an array A of N integers, A forms a mountain, write a program to find the index of peak element
